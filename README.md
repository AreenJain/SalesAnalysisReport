A sales analysis report is a document that provides a complete overview of your sales trends, volume, and overall sales activities. It shows the trends
that occur in a company's sales volume over time, and whether sales are increasing or declining. The main goal of this report is to inform you 
whether there is an increase or reduction in sales.
